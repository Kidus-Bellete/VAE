## Introduction

Anomaly detection and localization is crucial in various domains, such as industrial inspection, medical imaging, and security. This project utilizes a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) architecture augmented with additional features to improve the performance of anomaly detection and localization.

## Features

- Variational Auto Encoder with feature augmentations
- Anomaly detection and localization
- Support for MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset
- Easy to use training and testing scripts

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kidus-Bellete/VAE.git
cd VAE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

To train the FAVAE model, run:

```bash
python train.py --obj bottle --do_aug
```

You can adjust the training parameters in the `train.py` script.

### Testing

To test the trained FAVAE model, run:

```bash
python test.py
```

Results will be saved in the `results` directory.

## Datasets

The `datasets` directory contains scripts for loading and preprocessing datasets. The primary dataset used is the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset. Download the dataset from the official website and place it in the appropriate directory `train_patches` folder.

## Results

The results of anomaly detection and localization will be saved in the `results` directory. This includes:

- Original test images
- Reconstructed images
- Pixel-wise anomaly score maps
- Thresholded anomaly localization maps
- ROC curves and AUC scores for anomaly detection performance

These outputs allow for both quantitative evaluation of the model's performance and qualitative assessment of its anomaly localization capabilities.
